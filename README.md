# banking-app
A small banking system simulation

This is a mini-application for a banking system in Java.
 In this program, we will add some basic functionalities of a bank account like a deposit of amount,
 withdrawal of amount, etc.

 Future updates that still need to be implemented:
 > Asking a first time user to register an account
 > Not allowing withdrawal transactions when the balance is less than 0
 > Display properties
 > Testcases
 > Database to store registered users and pins

 To run this application from any terminal cd to the root of WeBank and execute  mvn exec:java
